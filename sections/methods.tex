The overall pipeline of this study, including the design of MTSCCleav, is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}.
In this session, we first discuss data preparation.
We then briefly review the concepts of time series and propose time series encoding methods.
After that, time series classifiers are discussed.
Finally, we discuss the evaluation metrics.

\subsection{Data preparation}
We used miRBase database~\cite{MiRBaseToolsMicroRNA2008}\footnote{The website is \url{www.mirbase.org}, and the newest version of the database is Release 22.1 (Accessed on 2025-06-22).}. 
The database comprises miRNA data from various organisms, including humans, mice, and C. elegans~\cite{MiRBaseConverterBioconductorPackage2018}.
Each data entry refers to a miRNA sequence, along with other properties such as name, accession (the identifier used in miRBase), organism (its origin), and information on its derivative miRNA products.
We are interested in pri-miRNA in humans.
The derivative miRNA products are the mature miRNAs. 
The database also annotates the location of the mature miRNA within the original pri-miRNA and indicates whether its existence has experimental evidence.

\end{table}
The database contains 38589 miRNA records.
Table~\ref{tab:miRBase} shows its four representative records.
We use it to elucidate our selection criteria. 
The records are rows in the table.
We selected the records from humans (Homo sapiens).
It resulted in 1917 records.
To identify the actual locations of the two cleavage sites in the pri-miRNA sequence supported by experimental evidence, we selected records that have two mature miRNAs resulting from cleavage at the 5p-arm and the 3p-arm, both of which have experimental support.
According to the above selection criteria, only ``MI0000060'' would be selected in the table.
After the selection process, we selected 827 experimental validated pre-miRNA sequences, each with its two mature miRNA products.
This formed our dataset.

    \label{tab:hsa-let-7a-1}
\end{table}
The entire sequence and the necessary information for our downstream analysis of ``hsa-let-7a-1''  are listed in Table~\ref{tab:hsa-let-7a-1}.

\subsubsection{Argument the dataset with Secondary Structure information}
We aim to utilize domain knowledge about pre-miRNA sequences to enhance the accuracy of our classifier. 
We leverage the secondary structure of these sequences to achieve this.
Recall that a specific three-dimensional (3D) structure is required for DNA, RNA, and protein to perform functions~\cite{UnderstandingBioinformatics2008}.
However, finding these 3D structures using experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is costly and time-consuming.
Hence, prediction methods for such 3D structures are necessary and helpful for downstream analysis.
However, predicting such 3D structures is challenging. 
One of the reasons is that there are some “nonconventional” base-pair interactions 
% (e.g., noncanonical and rare A-G) 
that allow an RNA structure to fold into a 3D structure. 
% in addition to the (G, U) wobble pair, which are common and functionally important in RNA secondary structures. 
% It makes the search space for prediction much larger than, in the 2D case, the secondary structure.
The local structure of the 3D structures, the secondary structures, only focus on the conventional base-pair interactions~\cite{MolecularBiologyCell2022}.
It facilitates the prediction of secondary structure more easily and effectively than predicting the 3D structure.
% Secondary structure can still shed light on some of these functions in the structure-function relationships.
We employed RNAfold from the ViennaRNA Package\footnote{The latest stable release is Version 2.7.0, accessed on 2025-06-22) to predict the secondary structure for a given pri-miRNA~\cite{ViennaRNAPackage202011}.}.
RNAfold returns the secondary structure in the dot-bracket notation and a matrix of base-pair probabilities.
\begin{definition}[Dot-bracket notation] 
\label{def:dot-bracket}
Dot-bracket notation is a way of representing the secondary structure of the given string $s$. 
One of the following symbols is assigned to each base in $s$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Open parentheses ``$($'' indicates that the base is paired with a complementary base further along in $s$.
  \item Close parentheses ``$)$'' indicates that the base is paired with a complementary base earlier in $s$.
  \item Dot ``$.$'' indicates that the base is unpaired.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Equipped with the matrix, we can construct the base-pair probability sequence of the original sequence. 
% For the unpaired nucleotide, its base pair probability is 0.  
An illustrative example is shown in Table~\ref{tab:hsa-let-7a-1}.

\subsubsection{Extract cleavage patterns}
The locations of the two mature miRNAs on the main sequence indicate the probable locations of the two cleavage sites. 
The 5p cleavage site must be beyond and near the ending location of the 5p mature miRNA. 
For example, the ending position of the 5p mature miRNA for ``hsa-let-7a-1'' is 27. So, the 5p cleavage site would be one of the bonds beyond the 27\textsuperscript{th} nucleotide. 
We deemed the immediate bond next to the 5p mature miRNA's ending position the 5p cleavage site, with the knowledge that the actual cleavage site may not be this immediate bond but rather the nearby bonds after it. 
The same applies to the 3p cleavage site. It is at the immediate bond before the starting position of the 3p mature miRNA, which is 57.

We extracted a 14-string (i.e., string with length $= 14$) with the cleavage site located at the center.
The first 7 nt (nucleotide) before the center are \textcolor{red}{\textbf{bolded}}.
In our running example, it would be ``\textcolor{red}{\textbf{UAUAGUU}}UUAGGU'' for the 5p cleavage site and ``\textcolor{red}{\textbf{GAGAUAA}}CUAUACA'' for the 3p cleavage site.
We call these 14-strings cleavage patterns as they contain the cleavage sites.
We can also generate non-cleavage patterns by selecting a 14-string with the center 6 nt away from the corresponding cleavage sites towards the corresponding mature miRNA~\cite{LBSizeCleavImprovedSupport2016, ReCGBMGradientBoostingbased2021}.
% For example, the bond that is 6 nt away from the 5p cleavage site towards 5p mature miRNA is the bond between 21\textsuperscript{st} and 22\textsuperscript{nd} nucleuotides.
It is based on the assumption that the dicer is less likely to cut the middle of the mature miRNA than the opposite side.
So, in our example, the 5p non-cleavage pattern would be ``\textcolor{red}{\textbf{AGGUUGU}}AUAGUUU''.
The center of the 3p non-cleavage pattern is the bond between 62\textsuperscript{nd} and 63\textsuperscript{rd} nucleuotides. 
The 3p non-cleavage pattern would be ``\textcolor{red}{\textbf{ACUAUAC}}AAUCUAC''.

In conclusion, for a given pri-miRNA, we can generate two cleavage patterns (positive samples) and two non-cleavage patterns (negative samples).
For convenience, we also call these four patterns simply the ``four strings'' of a given pri-miRNA.

    \label{tab:hsa-let-7a-1_eight_strings}
\end{table}
The four strings of ``hsa-let-7a-1'' are listed in Table~\ref{tab:hsa-let-7a-1_eight_strings}.

We could construct the complementary strand of each of the strands in the ``four strings'' by finding the corresponding paired base for each of the bases in the input strand by considering the secondary structure information. 
% Bases refer to the nucleotides. These two terms are used interchangeably.
We use `\_' to denote the unpaired base in the complementary strand.
For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:hsa-let-7a-1_ss}, the sub-string ``UUAGG'' in the 5p-cleavage pattern ``UAUAGUUUUAGGGU'' is unpaired while other bases do pair with some bases in the complementary strand, the resulting complementary strand is ``AUAUCAA\_\_\_\_\_UA''. 
% Note that the five underscores indicate that ``UUAGG'' is unpaired. 
There is a loop/ budge there.

% The strand and its complementary strand together can then encode the loop/ budge information.
We call the four original input strands and the constructed four complementary strands together as the ``eight strings'' of the input pre-miRNA, also shown in Table~\ref{tab:hsa-let-7a-1_eight_strings}.
% We are now ready to transform the ``eight strings'' into time series.
% Of note, we also have the base pair probability sequences that are of the same length as these strings. 

\subsection{Time Series Encoding}
\begin{definition}[Time Series and Subsequence] 
\label{def:ts}
A time series $T = t_1, t_2, ..., t_n$ is a sequence of real-valued numbers with length = $n$. A short contiguous region of $T$ is called a subsequence. 
A subsequence $T(i:j)$ of a time series $T$ is a shorter time series that starts from position $i$ and ends at position $j$.
% Formally, $T(i:j) = t_i, t_{i+1}, ..., t_j$, where $1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$.
\end{definition}

% They are the values on the x-axis if we plot them on an x-y plane.
Strings and time series are temporal sequences. 
% The order in a sequence usually represents time ordering. 
The primary difference between strings and time series lies in their behavioral attributes~\cite{DataMiningTextbook2015}. 
% They are the values on the y-axis.
For strings, also known as words, a y-value is a symbol from a predefined set called the alphabet. 
Thus, we also refer to the symbols as letters.
For example, the alphabet is $\{A, C, G, T\}$ in the DNA string, while $\{A, C, G, U\}$ in the RNA string.
For time series, a y-value is a scalar number. The number can be an integer or a real number. 
Unlike real numbers, there is no ordering in the alphabet unless some external domain knowledge is introduced.

In the bioinformatics community, the study of applying signal processing techniques to genomic data, which includes DNA and RNA strings, is called ``Genomic Signal Processing'' (GSP)~\cite{DNANumericalRepresentations2017}.
In the field of GSP, the time series representations of DNA strings are called DNA numeric representations (DNR).
Many DNRs have been proposed in the field of GSP, with applications including identifying protein-coding regions in DNA sequences~\cite{IdentificationProteinCodingRegions2011}, biological sequence querying~\cite{TimefrequencyBasedBiological2010}, and finding similarities between DNA sequences~\cite{NovelMethodComparative2014}.
We noted that DNA strings and RNA strings are equivalent from a computational standpoint. 
% They are simply strings with different alphabets.
Many transformation methods designed for DNA are applicable to RNA by simply substituting $T$ for $U$.
We present the nine encoding methods. The relationship among them is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:encodings_relationship}.

One of the simple, if not the simplest, transformations is to map the letters in the alphabet into integer numbers without considering any domain knowledge about the nucleotides.
This method or approach is called the ``Single value mapping''~\cite{SearchingMiningTrillions2012, ConversionNucleotidesSequences2002, AutoregressiveModelingFeature2004, DNASequencesClassification2001, DNANumericalRepresentations2017}.
One single value is assigned to each of the letters.
Domain knowledge can be utilized during assignments.
For example, \cite{ATCGNucleotideFluctuation2007} employs the atomic number of each nucleotide as the transformed values, where $\{G: 78, A: 70, C: 58, T: 66\}$.
\cite{CodingMeasureScheme2006} uses ``electron-ion'' interaction potential representation (EIIP) as such values, where $\{G:0806, A:1260, C:1340, T:1335\}$.
Our goal is to transform the input strand and its complementary strand into two time series, aiming to capture the information contained in these sequences and their secondary structure.
So, we need to employ the complementarity property during the transformation~\cite{DNANumericalRepresentations2007}.
Recall that in the base-pairing rules, ``A'' pairs with ``U''\footnote{In DNA, ``A'' pairs with ``T''} to form two hydrogen bonds while ``G'' pairs with ``C'' to form three hydrogen bonds. 
Hence, ``A'' (``C'') can be regarded as the ``inverse'' of ``U'' (``G'')~\footnote{Recall that we call ``-1' as the inverse of ``1''' and vice versa under addition in Algebra.}.
We can preserve these base-pairing rules in the time series 
representation by assigning A (G) and U (C)  opposite values.
% The time series of the complementary strand would then be a flipped version along the y-axis of the original strand. 
% We grouped the four nucleotides by their chemical structures.
`A' and `G' have a two-ring structure. They are purines.
`U' and `C' have a one-ring structure. They are pyrimidines.
We put `A' and `G' (`U' and `C') on the same side of the number line with zero in the middle.

Now, the only remaining question is which nucleotide on the same side we should assign a larger absolute value to.
% For example, for ``A' and `'G'', which one should be assigned a larger absolute value?
We adopted the ``A = 2 and G = 1'' assignment.
The reasoning is as follows.
The main goal of this manuscript is to find the two cleavage sites on the pre-miRNA.
The cleavage sites are the bonds along the strands, the phosphodiester linkages.
After the pre-miRNA is cleaved, the resulting double-stranded miRNA molecule is unwound to form the guide strand and the passenger strand.
The stability of the double strand would affect the unwinding process.
There are three hydrogen bonds in C-G pairs and two in A-U pairs. 
Hence, C-G pairs are more stable than A-U pairs.
This means that in regions with more C-G pairs, the double strands hold more tightly, and the unwinding process is less likely to occur than in regions with more A-U pairs. 
So, we want to emphasize the existence of such less stable A-U pairs in the double strands in our time series representations. 
We assign A and U with larger absolute values than those of G and C.
With this reasoning, we propose our first transformation method, as shown in row 1 of Table~\ref{tab:ts_encoding}. 

We can also transform each RNA sequence into a multivariate time series using grouped binary encoding, where nucleotides are grouped into (A, U) and (G, C). Each time series channel indicates the presence of a nucleotide from the respective group at each time step.
The kind of methods releases our assumption that A (U) has a larger absolute value than G (C).
Noted that each channel may differ in length depending on group-specific occurrences, we propose two variations. The first one allows the output to be variable-length sequences per channel. The second one always returns two resulting sequences of fixed length.
These methods are rows 2 and 3 in Table~\ref{tab:ts_encoding}. 

The ``Single value mapping'' and its two variations allow us to focus on the absolute values of the alphabet and ignore what has happened in the past.

\subsubsection{Cumulative mapping}
The ``cumulative version'' allows us to focus on analyzing the ``trend'', such as increasing and decreasing, by accumulating what has happened in the past~\cite{CurvesIntutiveTool1994, VisualizationAnalysisDNA2004}.
We show the ``Cumulative mapping'' in row 4 in the Table~\ref{tab:ts_encoding}.
We can also use two channels to represent the time dynamics of a nucleotide group in ``Cumulative mapping''. 
For the output, we can allow variable-length channels or fixed-length channels.
These two variations are illustrated in rows 5 and 6 of the table.

% Of note, some our proposed transformations are lossy.
% Lossy transformation refers to a transformation that does not allow us to restore the original string from the new time series representation.
% Methods 2, 4, and 5 are lossy.
% It does not guarantee that lossless transformation performs better than lossy transformation for the downstream analysis because lossy transformation may provide better generalization.

\end{table}

We can incorporate the base-pair probabilities in the encoding by multiplying the base-pair probability of the nucleotide with the assigned value of that nucleotide during encoding.
They are treated as the weight or confidence of that numerical assignment of the nucleotide.
Table~\ref{tab:ts_encoding_prob} incorporates the base-pair probability time series into the transformation methods listed in Table~\ref{tab:ts_encoding}.
% Recall that RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm is a kind of RNA folding algorithm.
% The RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm returns the predicted secondary structure of a given RNA sequence, a planar graph such as the minimum free energy structure.
% It also returns a probability matrix for the base-pair probabilities, which denote the probabilities of pairing one nucleotide with the other nucleotide.
% In our case, the bases in an RNA sequence will either be paired with another base in the same sequence or remain unpaired.
% For example in Figure~\ref{fig:hsa-let-7a-1_ss}, the 1\textsuperscript{st} base `U' is paired up with the 80\textsuperscript{th} base `A'.
% The 6\textsuperscript{th} base `U' is unpaired.
% The width and height of the probability matrix correspond to the length of the RNA sequence, as it is a pairwise matrix.
% From this matrix, we can construct the base-pair probability time series $s^P$ of the whole sequence $s$.
% The unpaired base will have very small probabilities in any base-pair.
% In our formulation, we deemed these small probabilities as $0$ to emphasize that these bases are deemed to be unpaired in the resulting predicted secondary structure. 

\subsubsection{Accumulating from the beginning of the pre-miRNA sequence}
In cumulative encoding, it would return a different result if we choose different starts for the accumulation.
We can start the accumulation from the beginning of the full sequence or just from the beginning of the selected local subsequence.
The first one preserves the global context by recording the previous counts of the nucleotide up to the selected subsequence.
It can be useful when early elements (those before the selected subsequence) influence later interpretation. 
In other words, the previous nucleotides may affect the chemical property of the selected subsequence.
The second one only focuses on the local history by ignoring the global history.
% The time series encoded in this way is more consistent.
It is useful if the previous nucleotides do not affect the chemical property of the selected subsequence.

Considering the time series representation of the running example $s = GAGAUAACUA$ in ``Cumulative mapping'' in Table~\ref{tab:ts_encoding} $t = 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 4, 6, 8, 7, 5, 7$, it accumulates from zero.
% $s$ is the first ten nucleotides of the non-cleavage pattern on the 3p-arm of “hsa-let-7a-1”.
According to Figure~\ref{fig:hsa-let-7a-1_ss}, $s = S[50:60]$
In other words, it begins at the 50\textsuperscript{th} position of the whole pre-miRNA sequence, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:hsa-let-7a-1}.
If we start the accumulation from the first entry $S[1]$ of the whole pre-miRNA sequence instead, it will yield a different result.
Suppose the last entry of the resulting time series of S[1:49] with Cumulative mapping encoding is 2, the resulting time series of $s$ would be $2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 6, 8, 10, 9, 7, 9]$ if we start the ``Cumulative'' at the beginning at S[1]. 
Note that these two time series have the same trend, but they start at different values. The first one starts at $2$ while the latter one starts at $0$. 
We name the first approach as ``Global Cumulative'' and the latter one as ``Local Cumulative'' or simply ``Cumulative''.
% After Z-normalization, these two time series will have similar trends but not the same trends as they have different means and variances.
We can apply the ``Global'' notion to every cumulative method in the Table~\ref{tab:ts_encoding}

\subsubsection{Transforming the secondary string into time series}
We can apply a similar idea to transform the secondary string in the dot-bracket notation into a time series by ``Single value mapping'', where ``('' maps to 1, ``.'' maps to 0, and ``)'' maps to -1.

\subsection{Time series classification}
% In this study, we propose a novel approach to predict human dicer cleavage sites by reframing this task as a multivariate time series classification problem.
In univariate time series classification, an instance in the dataset consists of a time series $x = x_1, x_2, ..., x_m$ with $m$ observations and a discrete class label $y$, which takes $c$ possible values.
If $c = 2$, we refer to these problems as binary classification problems.
If $c > 2$, we refer to these problems as multiclass classification problems.
In multivariate time series classification, the time series is not a single sequence but a list of vectors over $d$ dimensions and $m$ observations.
$x = <x_1, x_2, ..., x_d>$, where $x_k = x_{1,k}, x_{2,k}, ..., x_{m,k}$.
We also denote the $j$\textsuperscript{th} of the $i$\textsuperscript{th} case of dimension $k$ as a scalar number $x_{i,j,k}$.

There are many classifiers defined for time series data, including distance-based, feature-based, interval-based, shapelet-based, dictionary-based, convolution-based, and deep learning-based classifiers. Additionally, two or more of the above approaches can be combined, resulting in hybrid approaches~\cite{BakeReduxReview2024}.
For a complete review of time series classification, we would like to direct the readers to~\cite{BakeReduxReview2024, GreatMultivariateTime2021, GreatTimeSeries2017} for details.
As our downstream classifier, we employ convolution-based classifiers due to their simplicity and accuracy.

\subsubsection{Convolution-based classification}
Convolution-based classifiers first use randomly parameterized kernels to perform convolutions on the original time series.
Each convolution is performed by sliding a kernel across the original time series and computing a dot product.
The output of this process is another time series, namely an activation map.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figures/rocket_convolution.pptx.pdf}}
\caption{Features generation in the transformation}
\label{fig:rocket_convolution}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:rocket_convolution} shows two kernels $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ , each of which performs convolution with $T$.
For example, $\omega_1$ performs dot product with $T(1:3)$ and result $3$ as the first entry of the activation map.
By sliding the kernel one time stamp at a time, an activation map is produced for each kernel.
Then, the summary features are derived from the activation map, such as the maximum and proportion of positive values.
The most popular convolution-based approach is the Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (ROCKET)~\cite{ROCKETExceptionallyFast2020}.
It generates a large number of randomly parameterized kernels, ranging from thousands to tens of thousands.
The kernel's parameters include length (It defines the kernel's length), weights (the entries inside the kernel), bias (valued added to the result of the convolution operation).
Besides, padding can be applied on the input series at the start and the end, such that the activation map has the same length as the input.
The summary statistics are obtained through two pooling operations: the max and the proportion of positive values (PPV).
Hence, for $k$ kernels, the transformed data has $2k$ features.
The default value of $k$ is $10000$.
There are two extensions of ROCKET.
They are MiniRocket~\cite{MiniRocketVeryFast2021} and MultiRocket~\cite{MultiRocketMultiplePooling2022}.
MiniRocket removes unnecessary operations and many of the random components of ROCKET.
It speeds up Rocket by over an order of magnitude with no significant difference in accuracy, making the classifier almost deterministic.
For example, the kernel length is fixed, and only two weight values are used.
Only PPV is used for the summary statistics.
MultiRocket is extended from MiniRocket.
The main improvement of it is to extract features from first-order differences and add three new pooling operations.
The three added operations are mean of positive values (MPV), mean of indices of positive values (MIPV) and longest stretch of positive values (LSPV).

% Hydra
The HYbrid Dictionary-ROCKET Architecture (Hydra) is a time series classification model that combines dictionary-based and convolution-based models~\cite{HydraCompetingConvolutional2023}.
Similar to ROCKET-family classifiers, it uses random 1D convolutional kernels to extract features from the input time series.
But it groups the kernels into $g$ groups of $k$ kernels each.
Each time series is passed through all the groups.
For each group of kernels, we slide them across $T$ and compute the dot product at each timestamp.
Recall that the dot product of two input vectors has the maximum value when the two vectors align in the same direction and the minimum value when they are oriented in different directions.
We record the kernel that best matches the subsequence of T at each timestamp.
This results in a k-dimensional count vector for each of the $g$ groups.
It results in a total of $g \times k$ features, with default values of $g = 64$ and $k=8$.
In addition to recording the kernel with the maximum response, we can also record the kernel with the minimum response, with the knowledge that this kernel would be the best match with the ``inverted'' subsequence of $T$.
Hydra is applied to both the original time series and its first-order differences.
\cite{HydraCompetingConvolutional2023} concatenate features from Hydra with features from MultiRocket to obtain the best result.
This classifier is called MultiROCKET-Hydra. 

Typically, convolution-based approaches employ a simple design pattern, which involves the overproduction of features followed by a selection strategy.
A large number of features are generated for each instance. 
The derived features from the transformation methods are then fed into a simple linear classifier to obtain the final classification result.
Then, a simple classifier such as a linear ridge classifier determines which features are most useful.
A ridge classifier is used in this study.
It is a linear classifier that extends ridge regression to classification tasks by applying a threshold to the predicted values.
It uses L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
The regularization strength is selected by internal cross-validation.
A Ridge classifier is suggested for small datasets, as in our case, while a logistic regression classifier is suggested for large datasets~\cite{BakeReduxReview2024}.

\subsection{Evaluation metrics}
To evaluate the performance of our time series-based classification model, we adopted five standard classification metrics.
They are Accuracy (Acc), Specificity (Sp), Sensitivity (Sn), F1 score (F1), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)~\cite{ComparisonPredictedObserved1975}.
\begin{align*}
Acc &= \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \\
Sp &= \frac{TN}{TN + FP} \\
Sn &= \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \\
F1  &= \frac{2 \times TP}{2 \times TP + FP + FN} \\
MCC &= \frac{TP \times TN - FP \times FN}{\sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}}
\end{align*}
Where TP, TN, FP, and FN are the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively. 

% 3.4.4.1. From binary to multiclass and multilabel
% https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#from-binary-to-multiclass-and-multilabel
To extend a binary metric to multiclass problems, we can treat the data as a collection of binary problems, one for each class.
One class is treated as positive while the other classes are treated as negative.
Then, the multiclass metrics can be obtained by averaging binary metric calculations across the set of classes.
There are different ways to do the averaging.
Here, we adopted a macro-averaging approach.
It treats each class equally and calculates the mean of the binary metrics.
% 3.4.4.13. Matthews correlation coefficient
% https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#matthews-correlation-coefficient
To use $MCC$ in the multiclass case, it can be defined in terms of a confusion matrix $C$ for $K$ classes, where $C_{i,j}$ is the number of observations that are actually in class $i$ and predicted to be in class $j$~\cite{ComparingTwoKcategory2004}.  
\begin{align*}
MCC_{multi} = \frac{c \times s - \sum_k^K p_k \times t_k}
{\sqrt{(s^2 - \sum_k^K p_k^2) \times (s^2 - \sum_k^K t_k^2)}}
\end{align*}
Where $t_k = \sum_i^K C_{ik}$ (The number of times class $k$ actually occurred), $p_k = \sum_i^K C_{ki}$ (The number of times class $k$ was predicted), $c = \sum_k^K C_{kk}$ (The total number of samples correctly predicted) and $s = \sum_i^K \sum_j^K C_{ij}$ (The total number of samples).
