\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
For the result of predictive performance, from Table~\ref{tab:pred_res_trans_methods} and Figures~\ref{fig:best_model_cd}, \ref{fig:best_encoding_cd}.

Out of the three datasets, the best classifier is ROCKET.
The ranking of the five classifiers by performance, starting from the best, is as follows: ROCKET, Hydra, MiniROCKET, MultiROCKET-Hydra, MultiROCKET.

On the 5p-arm dataset, the best encoding method is ``Global Cumulative grouped fixed-length channel mapping''.
On the 3p-arm and multi-class datasets, the best encoding method is ``Global Cumulative mapping''.

Fixed-length grouped channel mappings outperform variable-length counterparts, likely because fixed-length schemes better preserve the original positional information of nucleotides within the sequence.

Global cumulative encodings, which compute cumulative mappings starting from the beginning of the sequence, consistently yield better performance than local cumulative or non-cumulative methods.

Cumulative-based encodings perform better than single-value mappings, suggesting that the accumulated nucleotide signal is more informative for cleavage site prediction than the local or isolated presence of nucleotides.
