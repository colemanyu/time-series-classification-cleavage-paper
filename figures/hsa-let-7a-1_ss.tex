\caption{
Predicted secondary structure of the sequence $S$ of pri-miRNA ``hsa-let-7a-1''\protect\footnotemark.
Experimental evidence suggests that the two deviated mature miRNAs are $UGA \cdots GUU$ and $CUA \cdots UUC$.
They are $S(6:27)$ and $S(57:77)$ (Both ends are inclusive.).
The ends are highlighted in \textcolor{red}{\textbf{bold}}.
Since $S(6:27)$ ($S(57:77)$) is near the 5' (3') end, we call it ``5p (3p) mature miRNA''. 
% It suggests that the two cleavage sites are the two bonds immediately after the 27\textsuperscript{th} nucleotide and before the 57\textsuperscript{th} nucleotide.
The two scissors indicate the two cleavage sites.
The color intensity of the nodes reflects their base-pair probability in this predicted secondary structure.
The deeper the color, the higher the probability.
The unpaired nodes are uncolored.
